Here we briefly describe how to use the available software.

In this directory you can find the "gr_src" file which
contains the SCFG which is described in [Pereira,92].

1. We generate a bracketed sample.

   ../scfg_gstr -g gr_src -c 100 -p "[ ]" > sample

2. We adequately separate the brackets in the "sample" file.

   sed  -e s'/\[/ \[ /g' -e s'/\]/ \] /g' sample | \
   sed s'/ \+/ /g' > tmpsample
   mv tmpsample sample

3. We construct a SCFG.

   ../scfg_cgr -g gr_src -f gr_new

4. We train this SCFG with the Inside-Outside algorithm.

   ../scfg_learn -g gr_new -s sample -i 200
 
   This program can take some time.

5. We eliminate the brackets from the sample.

   sed  -e s'/\[//g' -e s'/\]//g' sample | sed s'/ \+/ /g' > tmpsample
   mv tmpsample sample

6. We compute the probability of each string according to the
   estimated grammar.

   ../scfg_prob -g gr_new -m sample

7. Now, we train the SCFG with the Inside-Outside algorithm but
   without brackets in the sample.This program can take some
   time. Finally, we compute the probability of each string according
   to the estimated grammar.

   ../scfg_cgr -g gr_src -f gr_new
   ../scfg_learn -g gr_new -s sample -i 200
   ../scfg_prob -g gr_new -m sample
